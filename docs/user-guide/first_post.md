# First Post

After [setting up our blog](setup.md) we can finally write our first post!
In the [Editor View](http://localhost:3000/admin/) you will find a list of entry types.
Each type is used for a different purpose.

To write a simple "Hello World!" post, choose "Article".
An article has a title and content.
The content can be formatted with [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/)
Once you're happy with your text press the "Publish" button.

Congratulations, you just published your first blog post!
