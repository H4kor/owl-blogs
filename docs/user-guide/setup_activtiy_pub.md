# Setup ActivityPub

Owl-blogs will also publish your posts via ActivityPub.
By default the user name of your blog will be `@blog@<your.domain.com>`.

In the Module Configuration section of the admin page, click the "activity_pub" button.
Here you can change the the user name (`blog` by default) to any other name you prefer. 
The public and private keys don't have to be changed and should not be touched for the moment.
