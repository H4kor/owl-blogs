# Tags

Tags can help to organize posts and allow for easier discoverability of your writing.

Owl-blog uses a "in text" tagging system with hashtags.
Any `#whatever` in a content field will automatically be interpreted as a tag and converted to a link.
Tags must start with a letter and can contain lower- and uppercase letters, number, underscores (`_`) and dashes (`-`).
Tags are case insensitive, `#TAG` and `#tag` will be treated identical

In the footer of the blog you can find a link to the "Tags" page, where all used tags are listed, ordered by frequency.
Each tag has its own page where all tagged posts are listed.
