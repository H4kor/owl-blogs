# Menus

The header and footer menus of your blog can be extended by custom links.
To manage your menus to the admin page and open the configurations page "Menus".

To create a new menu entry choose whether the entry should be placed in the header or footer and specify the title of the entry.
You can specify the link by several different means.
Only one of these fields can be used for an entry:

- **Url:** can be used to link to an arbitrary URL. This is the most flexible option.
- **List:** is used to link to a [list](lists.md) of your blog. Enter the Id of the list.
- **Post:** is used to link to a single entry of your blog. Enter the Id of the entry. This is mostly used to link to pages, such as your imprint.
