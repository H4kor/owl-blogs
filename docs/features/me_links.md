# Me Links

Me Links can be used to link to your social media accounts and other websites.
These links will be tagged with [`rel="me"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/me), which is supported by many platforms to create verified links.

To create a new me link go to the admin page and open the Configuration page "Me Links".
Simply fill in the URL and name of the link.
All me links will be listed in the footer menu of your blog.
